# MLC597_Final_Project
This repository contains datasets, exploratory notebooks, and the final deliverable for IS597, Machine Learning in the Cloud environment. These notebooks require use of AWS SageMaker.

# MLC597_Final_Assignment_Hartman_Anna.ipynb
The notebook named MLC597_Final_Assignment_Hartman_Anna is the official deliverable for the final assignment and should be viewed first. 
It contains the whole pipeline created to include data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and model training. Evaluation of the 
included models is provided in this notebook as well. 

# diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv
This .csv file is the dataset used for the final deliverable. The additional 50/50 split dataset was used to identify preliminary differences in model performance,
but is not used as the official dataset for this project.

# all other notebooks and .csv datasets
Besides the named dataset and notebook above, all other notebooks are exploratory in nature and meant for the primary researcher's personal use. They are not 
intended to be clean or streamlined, but are rather isolated sandboxes used to help develop techniques used in the final deliverable.
